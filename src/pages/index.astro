  <Paragraph>Welcome to quack! We're excited to start providing a diverse range of online services tailored to meet your digital needs.

At quack, we believe in empowering users with choice and flexibility. That's why we started hosting online services, including Mastodon for federated/decentralized social networking and Matrix (WIP) for secure and federated/decentralized communication. But we're not stopping there â€“ stay tuned as we continue to expand our offerings.

If you'd like to reach out to us, please contact <NormalLink href="https://ahwx.org" text="Ahwx"/> or <NormalLink href="https://prpl.wtf" text="prpl"/>.</Paragraph>
